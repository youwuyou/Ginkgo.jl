# Ginkgo.jl

Ginkgo.jl is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) wrapper for the high-performance numerical linear algebra library [Ginkgo](https://ginkgo-project.github.io/) that
aims to leverage the hardware vendorâ€™s native programming models to implement highly
tuned architecture-specific kernels. Separating the core algorithm from these architecture-
specific kernels enables high performance while enhancing the readability and maintainability of the software.
